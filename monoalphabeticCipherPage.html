      The monoalphabetic cipher can be traced back to the earliest civilizations which used the system of cryptography to hide messages from enemies. By today's standards the cipher is quite easy to break, and therefore unusable, but its invention was crucial to the foundation and growth of cryptography.
      <br> <br>
      This cipher works by creating a random key, consisting of all letters of the alphabet arranged in a random order. This key is then used to translate the given message into an encoded message, by substiting each letter of the original message with the respective letter on the key. For example, if the first letter of the key was "c", all "a" characters in the original message would be replaced with "c". The tool on the left allows you to enter any message and a 26-letter key (if no key or an invalid key is entered, a random one will be generated), and will encrypt the message using this cipher, then display the encrypted message the key used to encrypt it. To decrypt the message, input the encrypted message in the message box, and the key it was encrypted with in the key box.
