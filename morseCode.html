      Morse code is a widely known and used code, that encodes messages into patterns of two signal lengths, known as dots and dashes. It is named after one of the inventors of the telegraph, Samuel Morse. Morse code can be used to transmit messages in the form of electric pulses, physical “beats”, audio beeps, and even flashes of light.
      <br><br>
      This tool works by taking an inputted message and dividing into its words, and then dividing those words into their letters. Then, the letters are replaced with their respective morse code symbols. Finally, the letters and words are put back together to form the encoded message. The encoded messages consist of periods (which represent “dits” or short-signals), dashes (which represent “dahs” or long signals), spaces (which separate letters), and backslashes (which separate words).
